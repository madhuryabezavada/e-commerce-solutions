Setting Up and Running the Application Locally
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed on your machine
NPM (Node Package Manager) installed
Steps:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <project-directory>
Install Dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
Set Environment Variables:

If your application requires environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, secret keys), create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables there.
Start the Server:

sql
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application:

Once the server is running, you can access the application at http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in your environment configuration.
Running Unit Tests
Prerequisites:
The application should be set up and running locally.
Steps:
Run Tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
View Test Results:

After running the tests, you'll see the test results displayed in the terminal. Additionally, you can check the generated test coverage report located in the coverage directory.
Deployment Considerations
Additional Steps for Deployment:
Configure environment variables for your production environment.
Use a process manager like PM2 or Supervisor to keep your Node.js application running in the background.
Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming HTTP requests and forward them to your Node.js application.
Use HTTPS to secure communication between clients and your server.
Monitor your application's performance and health using monitoring tools like New Relic, Datadog, or PM2 Plus.
Deployment Platforms:
Deploy your application to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or Heroku.
Follow platform-specific deployment guides and best practices provided by the hosting provider.
